K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into k clusters or groups.
The algorithm works by iteratively assigning each data point to the nearest cluster center and recalculating the cluster
centers until convergence is achieved.

The K-means clustering algorithm involves the following steps:

1. Initialization: Choose k initial cluster centers randomly from the data points or by other means. These initial centers are
the starting point for the algorithm.

2. Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest cluster center based on the Euclidean distance between the data point and the center.

3. Recalculation: Calculate the mean of the data points in each cluster, and use this value to update the cluster center.

4. Repeat: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence is achieved. Convergence is defined as no change in cluster assignments or cluster centers.

5. Output: The final output of the algorithm is k clusters, with each cluster containing the data points assigned to it.

The K-means algorithm is often used for exploratory data analysis, data compression, and image segmentation. However, it has
some limitations, such as the sensitivity to the initial cluster centers and the requirement to specify the number of clusters
in advance. There are also variations of the algorithm, such as the K-medoids algorithm, that can be used to address some of these limitations.

In Python, the K-means algorithm can be implemented using libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
