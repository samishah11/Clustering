Grid search is a hyperparameter tuning technique used to determine the best combination of hyperparameters for a machine learning model.
Hyperparameters are adjustable parameters that are set before training a model, such as learning rate, number of hidden layers,
or regularization strength. Grid search is a popular method for optimizing these hyperparameters by searching through all possible
combinations of hyperparameters in a predefined range.

Grid search with cross-validation (Grid Search CV) is a more advanced technique that uses k-fold cross-validation to evaluate each
combination of hyperparameters. In k-fold cross-validation, the data is split into k equal parts, or "folds", and the model is trained
and tested k times, with each fold serving as the test set once. This helps to reduce overfitting and provide a more accurate estimate 
of model performance.

Grid Search CV involves the following steps:

1. Define the hyperparameters to tune and their respective ranges.
2. Define the model to use for training and evaluation.
3. Define the evaluation metric to optimize (such as accuracy or AUC).
4. Use GridSearchCV class from scikit-learn library in Python, to perform the search across the hyperparameter space, by specifying 
the range of hyperparameters and the evaluation metric to optimize.
5. Fit the model to the training data and evaluate its performance using cross-validation.
6. Select the best hyperparameters based on the evaluation metric and train the final model using the best hyperparameters on the 
full training data.

Grid search with cross-validation can be a computationally expensive process, as it involves training and evaluating multiple models
with different combinations of hyperparameters. However, it can lead to significant improvements in model performance and is often
used in practice to fine-tune machine learning models.
